The source code is under proj4

the module paremeter is input_pid

The page faults are tested for 4 applications
i) Sysbench - cpu benchmark (CPU intensive)
ii) Iperf - network benchmark (IO intensive)
iii) Sed - Replacing every word of a large text file
iv) Strassen - Doing strassen multiplication between matrix of 2000 rows and cols (CPU and IO intensive)



We can infer that,

Page faults are frequent for IO intensive applications than CPU intensive applications.
